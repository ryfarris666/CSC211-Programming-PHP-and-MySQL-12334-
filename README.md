A student who does not adhere to the instructor’s and College’s attendance requirements may be dropped/withdrawn from the course as defined in the Yavapai College General Catalog.

Call or e-mail if you will not be in attendance. No-shows will be dropped. Tardiness is discouraged.  Excess Tardiness (more than 2) or being Tardy beyond 5 minutes is counted as an absence.  It is the student's responsibility to initiate a withdrawal from class should the need arise. I will withdraw you if you accumulate an absence within the first ten (10) days of class.  Official absences are only valid with proper documentation by a certified doctor, approved by the instructor or campus administration (see academic complaint form below).  Unofficial and Official absences are not eligible to earn attendance participation points.  Attendance participation points are not awarded if you leave class early.  Official absences can take the place of mandatory seat time.

COURSE WITHDRAWAL: A student-initiated withdrawal deadline is established by the college. If a student has not withdrawn from a class by the deadline, the student will receive the letter grade earned in the course at the end of the semester; earned grades will be posted on the student’s permanent record. Remember, instructors cannot withdraw students.  If a student has not withdrawn from a class by the deadline, the student will receive the letter grade earned in the course at the end of the semester; earned grades will be posted on the student’s permanent record.  For specific dates, see Academic Calendar.  Active participation in an online class is a measurable activity that requires a student to engage in materials and complete and submit some type of assignment.  Academic Calendar

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: Honesty in academic work is a central element of the learning environment. It is expected that students will submit their own work. The presentation of work not created by the student as one's own or the act of seeking unfair academic advantage through cheating, plagiarism, the prohibited use of generative AI, or other dishonest means are violations of the college’s Student Code of Conduct.

Definitions of plagiarism, cheating, and violation of copyright and penalties for violation are available in the Yavapai College Student Code of Conduct Links to an external site.Links to an external site.

STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT: Respect for the rights of others and for the college and its property are fundamental expectations for every student.

The Student Code of Conduct outlines behavioral expectations and explains the process for responding to allegations of student misconduct.

Students are expected to respond and write in a respectful, professional, and appropriate manner in all forms of communication and when activities are assigned to create scenarios, discuss opinions, present on a selected subject, or post to the web board. Inappropriate language or objectionable material will not be tolerated and could result in disciplinary measures and/or a failing grade for the class.

Safe Classroom Environment Statement: Disagreement within the classroom does not equal disrespect, you are encouraged to have different points of view, different opinions and values, however, it is required that students monitor their language within discussions. Racist, sexist, or homophobic language will not be tolerated. Consult the student handbook for college policies regarding these types of behavior.

CIVIL DIALOGUE STATEMENT: Regardless of venue or delivery method, faculty must ensure and maintain an environment appropriate for higher education. To promote a positive educational experience, appropriate and civil communication is an expectation of all students. All communication must remain respectful. Language or behavior that is threatening, intimidating, harassing, defamatory, libelous, or obscene is unacceptable.  Failure to abide by these standards may result in disciplinary measures. Please see Public Access and Expression on College Property (10.10)Links to an external site.Links to an external site. for further detail.

Some examples of generative AI tools include but are not limited to: ChatGPT, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Stable Diffusion, Grammarly AI Writing Assistant, and Adobe Firefly.

No Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Allowed

In this class, all work submitted must be your own. The use of generative AI tools will be considered academic misconduct and will be treated as such.
